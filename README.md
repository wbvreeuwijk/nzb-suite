* Downloads NZB files
* Searches for new episodes of your favourite show and downloads them when they appear
* Search for new movies and downloads them when they appear
* Add subtitles to your Movies and TV shows
* Combine multiple newzbin search providers into one simple interface
* Use Spotweb as an alternative newzbin provider

All you need is
1. A running docker environment
2. A usenet provider
